# Frequensee
Frequensee is a cyberpunk-themed dating app concept designed for Gen Z communities like gamers, cosplayers, and streamers. It addresses common pain points in modern dating apps such as swipe fatigue, ghosting, and lack of emotional connection. Key innovations include music-based matching via Spotify, AI-generated personas, mascot-led onboarding, and story-driven chat modes. The app integrates a tiered freemium model, digital cosmetics, and streamer-led Vibe Lobbies to enable monetization and community engagement. Frequensee reimagines dating as an immersive, emotionally safe experience built on identity and vibe over visuals.
